                The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes a you get closer to the equator.
                To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a datast on over 500 cities.
            </p>
                After assembling the datset, we used MatPlotlib to ploat various aspects of the weather vs. latitude.
                Factors we looked at included: temparatue, cloudiness, wind speed, and hunmidy.
                The site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explainations and descriptions of any trends and correlations wtinessed.
